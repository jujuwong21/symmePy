# symmePy
SymmePy is a Python project created for the course 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.
With this program, users can draw anything in a symmetric fashion. Users are able to choose the number of sides, the color of the brush/background, and the type of brush to create their masterpiece. After drawing, there is a mode that rotates the drawing.
A demonstration of the project can be found at the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxiRBdlQIyQ&lc=z23ef3zyxxunvj5pc04t1aokgmumoyhww3i41r5b0lctbk0h00410
