Juliette Wong15-112 Term ProjectRead Me	To run the project, one needs to open and run the SymmePy.py file. I have already imported all of the other py files into the document, and the other py files are in the folder.	The libraries that were used for this term project are tkinter, random, and math. Thus, nothing needs to be downloaded in order to open it.
